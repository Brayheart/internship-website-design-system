3. Launch Local Server `mkdocs serve`

### Working with issues

<!-- - Explain how to submit a bug.
- Explain how to submit a feature request.
- Explain how to contribute to an existing issue. -->

### Working with forks and branches

- **Forks**: Personal copies of other repositories.

To fork this repository, click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository. Then, clone your fork in the desired directory on your machine with:

`git clone https://github.com/{YOUR-GITHUB-HANDLE}/internship-website-design-system.git`

- **Branches**: a separate line of development created to work on new features or fixes independently from the main codebase.

When working in your fork, feature development/fixes should occur in dedicated branches rather than the `main` branch.

Once you have a feature/issue that you understand and are ready to work on:

- Ensure your fork remains current by updating it with the latest changes from the original repository.

  `git pull upstream main`

- Create a new branch

  `git checkout -b new-feat-branch`

- Make changes and review changed files with

  `git status`

- Add `git add <file_name>`, Commit `git commit -m "{message}"`, and Push `git push -u origin new-feat-branch` changes when ready.

For more information please refer to ["Git feature branch workflow"](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow#:~:text=The%20core%20idea%20behind%20the,without%20disturbing%20the%20main%20codebase).

### Working with pull requests and reviews

- Branches make **code reviews** possible through **pull requests** (PR).

After pushing your branch to the fork, navigate to the [original repository](https://github.com/hackforla/internship-website-design-system) on GitHub. You'll see an option to **"Compare & pull request"** for the branch you've just updated. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request for review.

### Testing

- Run the site locally with `mkdocs serve`
- Observe visual changes for desktop sized screens as well as mobile.
